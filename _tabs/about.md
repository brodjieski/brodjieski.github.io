Hello! I'm Dan. I am a Mac admin and enthusiast who's been tinkering with computers for as long as I can remember. I play video games, do some 3D printing, and dabble a bit with programming. I contribute to the macOS Security Compliance Project (MSCP) and help with cybersecurity on the Apple platforms at NASA. When I'm not in front of a screen, I'll do some mountain biking, bake some sourdough, or be cheering my kids's on at swimming or field hockey.

You can find me hanging out in the MacAdmins Slack @brodjieski, come say hi!
